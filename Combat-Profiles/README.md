# Combat Profiles

As for now there is a few profiles up, more will come with the time.

Each of the classes will have their own readme to tell how to set up and how most of the profile work.

## How to add Combat profile to bot

To add one of my combat profiles to your VanillaBot you need to download all my profiles.

Download All Profiles: [link](https://github.com/LoctusBin/Collection-of-Profiles/archive/master.zip)

After that you copy your selected profile (the .cpr file) to "/combat" folder in your bot folder. after that load it like a normal combat profile :)
