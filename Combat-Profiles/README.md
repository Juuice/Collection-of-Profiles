# 1-60 Combat Profiles  
As for now there are a few combat profiles up, more will come with the time.  
I will update and fix any issues there is, and if someone needs help with making a profile, just tell me.

It is intended that you can use my profiles from 1-60, so if there is something that are better than other spells in some levels, then just post an issue about it and i will fix it as soon as possible.


## How to add Combat profile to bot:  
1. First download all my profiles from link below or set up SVN.  
  :link: [Download Profiles](https://github.com/LoctusBin/Collection-of-Profiles/archive/master.zip)
2. Find your choice of profile (the *.cpr file) in the folder ":file_folder: Combat-Profiles", sorted after class then the profiles themselves.
3. Copy your selected profile over to ":file_folder: combat" folder in your bot main folder
4. Load it like a default combat profile :)

:exclamation: Remember to read if there is some custom macros that needs to be made to make the profile working.  
Most of the profiles uses bar 2 slot 0 to rest, if there are spells here it will cast it every time.
