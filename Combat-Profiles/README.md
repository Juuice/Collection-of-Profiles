# 1-60 Combat Profiles  
As for now there is a few combat profiles up, more will come with the time.  
I will update and fix anny issue there is, and if someone wats help with making a profile just tell me.

It is intended that you can use my profiles from 1-60, so if there is something that are better that other spells in some levels, then just post and issue about it and i will fix as soon as possible.

## How to add Combat profile to bot:  
To add one of my combat profiles to your VanillaBot you need to download all my profiles.  
Download All Profiles: [link](https://github.com/LoctusBin/Collection-of-Profiles/archive/master.zip)

After that you copy your selected profile (the .cpr file) to "/combat" folder in your bot folder. after that load it like a normal combat profile :)

And remember to read if there is some custom macro that needs to be made to get the profile up and going.
