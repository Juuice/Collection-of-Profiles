# 1-60 Combat Profiles  

All my profiles are intended to use 1-60. tell me if your find some issues.

###### Racial Spells
All my profiles now use Racial Spells, by doing that it will come up that you miss some spells when loading in the profile.  
You can double check the spell-ids in the profile, and take away the one your not using if you dont want that error, or leave them be.  
Some error about the missing spell-ids are talents btw, or that you forget to learn or equip new spells.

## How to add Combat profile to bot:  
1. First download all my profiles from link below or set up SVN: [(Link)](https://github.com/LoctusBin/Collection-of-Profiles.git)   [(Guide)](https://youtu.be/y3Yd12RIn90)  
  :link: [Download Profiles *.ZIP](https://github.com/LoctusBin/Collection-of-Profiles/archive/master.zip)
2. Find your choice of profile (the *.cpr file) in the folder ":file_folder: Combat-Profiles", sorted after class then the profiles themselves.
3. Copy your selected profile over to ":file_folder: combat" folder in your bot main folder
4. Load it like a default combat profile :)

:exclamation: Remember to read if there is some custom macros that needs to be made to make the profile working.  
Most of the profiles uses bar 2 slot 0 to rest, if there are spells here it will cast it every time.

## Notepad++ .cpr Language Template:  
The template is mostly for making it easier to look at the code and find out that your are using the right word etc.

###### How to add to Notepad++:
1. Open Notepad++ and In the menu "Language" choose "Define your language..."
2. In the new window click the "Import..." button. 
3. Find "Notepad++ cpr Language-Template.xml" in the folder ":file_folder: Combat-Profiles" from the profile folders
4. Then Open the file. from this moment on you can easy read down and know where the comments etc are.
