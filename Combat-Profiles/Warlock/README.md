# Nik's affliction warlock profile  
_Tweaked and made more userfriendly by me._  
[Original Post!](http://vanillabotter.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=149)

## Combat profile setup:  
- Improved use of Life Tap that allows for a better health and mana efficiency
- Use of Cannibalize (UD racial; obviously only works when killing humanoids and when the loot option is enabled
- Use of Amplify Curse
- More intelligent conditions on some spells; for example it won't start refreshing dots when the target is almost dead
- Improved spell priorities
- Slightly increased some spells' cooldown values so it won't cast dots/fear twice
- Use of Fear if your lock's health drops below 50%
- If it's in combat with more than one mob, the bot will first cast drain life in order to pull aggro from the other mobs and then cast Howl of Terror to fear them (obviously only works on melee NPCs)
- Will cast Soul Fire whenever it's ready and Drain Soul right after that (which doesn't always work yet)
- Will use health pot when in combat and about to die
- Curse of Tongues for caster mobs (commented out)
- Casts Deathcoil if below 50% health
- When in combat, it will now only cast Life Tap either when the health is almost full or when the mana is almost gone; this allows for the bot kill mobs faster while preserving the aforementioned mana/health efficiency; will use Life Tap though to make mana and health somewhat equal when out of combat

#### Mods By Loctus:  
- Imp when under lvl 10
- Imp if out of soul shard
- Scroll use
- Made more userfriendly
- Removed some race spesific spells
- And clean up the profile some :)
