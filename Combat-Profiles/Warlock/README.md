# Nik's affliction warlock profile  
_Tweaked and made more userfriendly by me._  
[Original Post!](http://vanillabotter.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=149)

## Combat profile setup:  
- Improved use of Life Tap that allows for a better health and mana efficiency
- Use of Cannibalize (UD racial; obviously only works when killing humanoids and when the loot option is enabled
- Use of Amplify Curse
- More intelligent conditions on some spells; for example it won't start refreshing dots when the target is almost dead
- Improved spell priorities
- Slightly increased some spells' cooldown values so it won't cast dots/fear twice
- Use of Fear if your lock's health drops below 50%

#### Mods By Loctus:  
- Imp when under lvl 10
- Imp if out of soul shard
- Scroll use
- Made more userfriendly
- Removed some race spesific spells
- And clean up the profile some :)
