# 1-60 Leveling profile for Shaman
_Work mostly like a Enhancement profile._

##### Offhand need to remove some "//" in the profile. Open profile in notepad and just read down.

This is not 100% tested from 1-60, but as it is set up it will work (i hope?), if problem then post about it as detailed as possible :)

This is something that i made for my shaman that i lvled up and stopped at lvl 23. not sure if im going to test the profile when im updating it. but will update from feedback.
as i can see i think i have most of the profile working like i wanted it to, but if something is better than other tell me so i can make this a good leveling profile :) 

## **Combat profile setup:**

**Buffs:**
- Lightning shield when out of combat and not up
- Will buff mainhand and offhand (Offhand need to remove some "//" in the profile. Open in notepad and just read down.)
- Rockbiter, Flametongue after lvl 10, and Frostbrand after lvl 20

**Healing routines:**
- Use Healing wave, Lesser healing wave after lvl 20
- Stop healing if only one target, and target is under 20% health
- Will heal up a bit when not in combat

**Combat routines:**
- Will pull with Lighting bolt
- Flame shock when dot is off (not tested)
- Use Earth shock on cooldown, frost shock after lvl 20
- Chain Lighting if 3 or more enemies if not having aggro
- Lightning bolt if clearcasting and dont have aggro
- Will also use Stormstike on cooldown

**Totems:**
- Healing totem
- Stoneskin totem before pulling
- Searing totem in combat
- Mana totem when out of battle and nothing to drink
- Will cast lightning shield before this to just stand by if none other is available and really low on mana
