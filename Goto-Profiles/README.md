# Goto Profiles
_To get from "A" to "B"_

If there is a chance to get killed there will be a Ghost way point so it will go back to checking for corpse where you can die.
Just started to do this as i wants to have an easy way to move from the starting area to the city.

## How to add Goto profile to bot:  
1. First download all my profiles from link below or set up SVN.  
  :link: [Download Profiles](https://github.com/LoctusBin/Collection-of-Profiles/archive/master.zip)
2. Find your choice of profile (the *.fpr file) in the folder ":file_folder: Goto-Profiles".
3. Copy your selected profile over to ":file_folder: farming" folder in your bot main folder.
4. Load it like a default farming profile and run as Grinding :)
5. Remember to stop the bot yourself when at destination, or the bot will go back.
